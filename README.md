# Online Textbooks

As you can see, this is China's standard textbooks.

All of these textbooks are originally from [the offical website](https://www.zxx.edu.cn/tchMaterial). 

Remember that you can only use it for **non-profit or educational purposes** for the textbooks are **copyrighted by the Chinese Ministry of Education and the National Textbook Committee**.

If you know a bit about command line, you can also use my friend [MrWillCom's downloader](https://github.com/MrWillCom/textbooksDownloader) for quicker downloading.
